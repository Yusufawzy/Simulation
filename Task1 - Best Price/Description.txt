The objective of this simulation model is to search (via experimentation) for the best price that maximizes the expected (average) revenue -- given the following equations:
Revenue = Sales Price 
Sales = Demand(Price/100)^-2

Possible Price range: 90-100 

Demand is an uncertain random variable.
Experts predict that the demand for the product is normally distributed with mean 1000 and standard deviation 100.
N.B. I generate many samples for Demand (say 1000 samples).
