Tie One On, an exclusive menâ€™s clothing store specializing in ties, is planning to develop a store in a new shopping mall. 
Customers are expected to arrive at the store location at random at an average rate of 40 per hour. I.e. IAT : Normal Distr. {60/40;6/40} (minutes).
The store will be open 10 hours per day.
Service time (of a customer) is assumed to follow a normal distribution {6,1} (minutes). The average sale to a customer is $22. 
Clerks are paid $20/hr. (including all benefits), and the cost of having a waiting customer is estimated to be $10 per customer per hour. 
One possibility is to have a small store staffed by 2 clerks This store, however, will only have room for a maximum of 3 customers to be present. Another possibility is to have a larger store with 6 clerks. The larger store can accommodate up to a total of 15 customers. 
It is believed that customers who arrive when the store is full will shop elsewhere. If the small store leases for $200 per day and the large store leases for $ 2000 per day, which configuration should be used?
